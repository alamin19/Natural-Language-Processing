# Natural-Language-Processing
Natural Language Proecssing(NLP) is used to apply Machine learning models to text and languages to predict certain outcome. In this project I have used  a dataset with 1000 observation and two columns. I have used NLTK library to build this project, and used NLP on Naive Bayes model and got the accuracy of 73% which not a bad prediction for this small dataset.
